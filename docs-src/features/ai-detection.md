# AI Detection

13-metric ensemble + 35-feature statistical detector. No ML models, no API keys.

## Quick Start

```python
from texthumanize import detect_ai, detect_ai_sentences, detect_ai_mixed

# Single text
result = detect_ai("Text to check.", lang="en")
print(f"{result['score']:.0%} — {result['verdict']}")

# Per-sentence detection
for s in detect_ai_sentences(long_text, lang="en"):
    emoji = '🤖' if s['label'] == 'ai' else '👤'
    print(f"{emoji} {s['text'][:80]}")

# Mixed content detection
mixed = detect_ai_mixed(text, lang="en")
print(f"AI segments: {mixed['ai_ratio']:.0%}")
```

## Metrics

| Metric | What It Measures |
|:-------|:----------------|
| AI Patterns | Formulaic phrases ("it is important to note", "furthermore") |
| Burstiness | Sentence length uniformity (humans vary, AI doesn't) |
| Opening Diversity | Repetitive sentence starts |
| Entropy | Word predictability (Shannon entropy) |
| Vocabulary | Lexical richness (type-to-token ratio) |
| Perplexity | Character-level predictability |
| Stylometry | Writing style consistency |
| Coherence | Paragraph flow and transitions |
| Grammar Perfection | Suspiciously perfect grammar |
| Punctuation | Punctuation variety and patterns |
| Rhythm | Sentence cadence uniformity |
| Readability | Consistency of reading level |
| Zipf | Word frequency distribution |

## Ensemble

The detection uses three methods combined:

- **Weighted sum** (50%) — normalized metric scores
- **Strong signal detector** (30%) — any single metric above threshold
- **Majority voting** (20%) — count of metrics flagging AI

## Verdicts

| Verdict | Score Range | Meaning |
|---------|:-----------:|---------|
| `human_written` | < 35% | Likely written by a human |
| `mixed` | 35–65% | Uncertain or mixed content |
| `ai_generated` | ≥ 65% | Likely AI-generated |

## Batch Detection

```python
from texthumanize import detect_ai_batch

texts = ["Text 1", "Text 2", "Text 3"]
results = detect_ai_batch(texts, lang="en")
for r in results:
    print(f"{r['score']:.0%} — {r['verdict']}")
```
