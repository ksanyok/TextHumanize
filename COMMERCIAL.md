# TextHumanize — Commercial Licensing

## Why Commercial?

TextHumanize is free for personal, academic, and non-commercial use. If your company uses TextHumanize in a product, service, or internal tool that generates revenue — you need a commercial license.

## FAQ

### Do I need a license for internal company tools?

**Yes**, if the tool is used in a business context (even internally). **No**, if it's a personal side project that doesn't generate revenue.

### Does the license cover all platforms (Python, PHP, TS)?

**Yes.** One license covers Python, PHP, and TypeScript/JavaScript — all platforms in this repository.

### Can I try it before buying?

**Yes.** The library is fully functional without a license key. The license is a legal agreement, not a technical restriction. Evaluate freely, then purchase when you go to production.

### What happens when my license expires?

You can continue using the version you had when the license was active. You just won't receive new updates or support until you renew.

### Do you offer discounts for startups or non-profits?

**Yes.** Contact us — we offer 50% off for registered non-profits and early-stage startups (< $1M ARR).

### Can I get an invoice?

**Yes.** We provide invoices for all tiers.
